# Disclaimer:

This is an archive of past presentations I have give to a variety of audiences. The presentations are in various formats, including PDF, PowerPoint, and Keynote. The presentations are organized by associated organization or event.

While this repo is public, the presentations are not intended for redistribution or reuse without permission. If you would like to use any of the content, please contact me directly. 

Additionally, many of the presentations were designed for conferences or workshops and may not be as useful without the accompanying narrative. I would advise you to use them as no more than a reference or inspiration for your own work.

I have created public-oriented versions of some of the presentations that are available on my [website](https://himmens.com/).

Please reach out if you have any questions.
